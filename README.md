# House Price Prediction using Random Forest and XGBoost

## Project Description

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features of the properties using machine learning models. The main objective is to build and compare the performance of two regression models: **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**. These models will be trained on a dataset containing different attributes of houses, such as square footage, number of rooms, location, and more.
