# House Price Prediction using Random Forest and XGBoost

## Project Description

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features of the properties using machine learning models. The main objective is to build and compare the performance of two regression models: **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**. These models will be trained on a dataset containing different attributes of houses, such as square footage, number of rooms, location, and more.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed. You also need to install the required libraries. You can do this by following the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house_prices.git

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Install the dataset**
   go to kaggle and find a good dataset or use dataset of this guy => https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syuzai/perth-house-prices
   P.S. Don't forget to change the rows name on the 14 line
